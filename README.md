### A Quick Summary
A simple website written using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`, built solely to show off the cool stuff I like to make. This website is meant to be hosted off of github pages, and does not contain any files for hosting a server. Please credit me if you use any source code in another website! I have written this from scratch, and don't want my work stolen and gone uncredited, even if it is horrible spaghetti code.

### What I Have So Far
- General Landing Page

- Quick Navigation Layout

- Finished About Page

- Socials

### Plans for the Future
I plan to continue development on this website until I feel it satisfies my need for a quick way to show off my work to employers or other people interested in what I do. This is meant to be used as a sort of resume when I finally start looking for a career in software/web development/design. I may add more ideas to the section above as I continue development.
